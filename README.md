# Corporate Organizational Gender Makeup Simulation

## Abstract
This study examines how recruiting and promotion decisions within businesses are impacted by
seniority and homophily. By examining these relationships, the research seeks to shed light on the
ways in which systemic organizational policies and identity-based biases interact to affect efficiency
and equity. This report’s conclusions and analysis give a solid basis for comprehending how these
factors affect organizational outcomes and offer useful guidance for developing and implementing
policies. The study addresses several key questions: How does seniority influence promotion
probabilities and overall employee retention? What role does homophily play in shaping promotion
and hiring outcomes? Lastly, how do varying levels of inherent bias, homophily, and seniority impact
organizational diversity and productivity? By answering these questions, the report aims to shed light
on the underlying mechanisms driving hiring and promotion decisions and their broader implications
for organizations

To explore these questions, the study employs a dynamic promotion framework that integrates multiple
factors influencing decision-making processes. Seniority is modeled as a normalized factor, where
an individual’s promotion probability is weighted by their tenure. This reflects real-world practices
where employees with greater tenure often have increased promotion opportunities. Homophily, or
the tendency of decision-makers to prefer candidates with similar identities or characteristics, is
incorporated through a similarity score parameter. This parameter, denoted as α, adjusts the likelihood
of selection based on shared traits. Additionally, inherent bias is represented by weight parameters
that influence promotion probabilities based on identity-based preferences. The interactions between
these factors are simulated using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) to capture promotion
rates and transitions across organizational levels.

The findings reveal critical insights into how seniority, homophily, and inherent bias shape hiring
and promotion outcomes. First, seniority weighting was found to reduce randomness in promotions,
leading to higher retention rates and stability within upper organizational levels. This effect was
particularly pronounced in simulations where seniority carried significant weight, as it created a more
deterministic promotion process. However, an overreliance on seniority could lead to bottlenecks, as
employees with long tenures might dominate promotion opportunities, potentially stalling organiza-
tional growth and innovation. Homophily played a significant role in shaping promotion outcomes.
Higher values of the homophily parameter (α) amplified decision-makers’ preferences for candidates
with similar identities, often exacerbating existing disparities within the organization. Sensitivity
analyses showed that as α increased, promotion outcomes became increasingly skewed, favoring
certain identity groups. This effect highlights the potential for homophily to undermine diversity
and equity, particularly in homogeneous organizations where decision-makers and candidates share
similar backgrounds. When homophily was removed from the model (α = 0), the simulations pro-
duced more equitable outcomes, suggesting that reducing homophily’s influence could be a key lever
for promoting diversity. Inherent bias further compounded the effects of seniority and homophily.
Simulations with higher bias weights demonstrated that identity-based preferences could amplify
disparities, especially in settings with low turnover. These findings underscore the importance of
addressing inherent biases to achieve more equitable promotion processes. Interestingly, simulations
combining seniority, homophily, and inherent bias revealed complex interactions, where the interplay
of these factors could either mitigate or exacerbate disparities depending on their relative weights.

The report also conducted sensitivity analyses to validate the robustness of its findings. Adjusting
parameters such as seniority weightings and homophily scores revealed consistent patterns, affirm-
ing the validity of the models. For example, increasing seniority weighting consistently reduced
randomness, while higher homophily scores skewed outcomes toward similarity-based preferences.
These analyses highlight the importance of balancing these factors to achieve desired organizational
outcomes.

The implications of these findings are significant for both theoretical exploration and practical
application. From a policy design perspective, the results suggest that interventions such as threshold
policies, like the Rooney Rule, could mitigate the adverse effects of homophily while preserving the
benefits of seniority-based decisions. Such policies could ensure a baseline level of diversity in hiring
and promotions without compromising efficiency. Additionally, the study highlights the need for
organizations to carefully calibrate their promotion criteria to balance equity and productivity. For
example, organizations might consider dynamic bias weights or external hiring policies to counteract
the effects of homophily and bias.

Looking ahead, there are several avenues for further research and practical application. Future
simulations could explore scenarios with dynamic bias parameters, where weights change over
time based on organizational interventions or external influences. Similarly, investigating the long-
term effects of external hiring policies on diversity and equity could provide valuable insights.
Practically speaking, companies might use these models to assess the effects of proposed policies
before implementation, enabling them to make informed choices that support their objectives for
equity and diversity.

This report’s conclusion emphasizes how intricately personal prejudices and systemic regulations in-
teract to influence hiring and promotion decisions. By integrating factors such as seniority, homophily,
and inherent bias into its models, the study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding
these dynamics. The findings offer actionable insights for organizations seeking to balance equity,
diversity, and efficiency, paving the way for more inclusive and effective promotion practices
